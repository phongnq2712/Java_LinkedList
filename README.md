Design and implement a tool which will determine the top
three places of the competition. You are given few samples, containing information about
participants, their candy collection and a few requests. Each request contains one/more
participant names. Your program will have to get the input through scanner and must
work for inputs other than the sample input as well. You will input this information and
will produce an outcome for each participant present in request(s). The outcome for each
request should be one of the following responses where X signifies the participant name. <br/ >
a) Participant X wins GOLD with collection having highest monetary value
b) Participant X wins GOLD with collection having highest monetary and utility value
c) Participant X wins SILVER with collection having second highest monetary value
d) Participant X wins SILVER with collection having second highest utility value
e) Participant X wins BRONZE with collection having third highest monetary value
f) Participant X wins BRONZE with collection having third highest utility value
g) Participant X is not in top three owing to collection with low monetary value
h) Participant X is not in top three owing to collection with low utility value
You can assume that the competition has finished and all relevant information is made
available. The information given to you may not be in any specific order (information
structure for each participant will be same but order in which participants are entered
will not be same).
